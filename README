** Description
asbarak is a great project

asbarak-server)
	contains generic features for asbarak apps

asbarak-apps)
	compliant apps

** Requirements :
maven2
vlc (opt.)
alsamixer (opt.)

** Installation :

Actually there is a problem with the maven deployement of FraSCAti specific maven plugins, so you need to manually install those plugins :

svn co svn://svn.forge.objectweb.org/svnroot/frascati/tags/frascati/frascati-1.3/frascati/maven-plugins/
cd maven-plugins/
mvn install

Then, you can install the asbarak maven artifacts by running $mvn install at the root of asbarak folder.

If you want the web-gui, you need to create the war :
- move to apps/podcasti-parent/web-gui/
- type $mvn -Ppodcasti-war
- then you can find the podcasti web-gui war file into the target folder, and move it to your application server webapps folder.

Finally, you can move to apps/podcasti-parent/logic/ and run $mvn -Ppodcasti

** Issues :

Because, FraSCAti and the war application are connected trough RMI, you need to configure your java.policy in order to allow Tomcat (for example) for using RMI communications.
