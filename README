asbarak-apps)
	compliant apps

** Requirements :
maven2
vlc (opt.)
alsamixer (opt.)

** Installation :

You can install the asbarak maven artifacts by running $mvn install at the root of asbarak folder.

If you want the web-gui, you need to create the war :
- move to apps/podcasti-parent/web-gui/
- type $mvn -Ppodcasti-war
- then you can find the podcasti web-gui war file into the target folder, and move it to your application server webapps folder.

Finally, you can move to apps/podcasti-parent/logic/ and run $mvn -Ppodcasti

** Issues :

Because, FraSCAti and the war application are connected trough RMI, you need to configure your java.policy in order to allow Tomcat (for example) for using RMI communications.
